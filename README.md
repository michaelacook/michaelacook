### Hi there, I'm Mike ðŸ––
I am an A+ certified IT technician and compulsive techie tinkerer.

I am currently working toward completing the Azure Administrator Associate (AZ-104). I've dabbled in various languages and frameworks in the past, but my current focus is PowerShell for Azure and Windows Server, as well as a bit of Bash.
