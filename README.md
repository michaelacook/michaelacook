### Hey there, I'm Mike ðŸ––
I am an IT professional and compulsive tinkerer. This is where I keep my projects, notes, and code. I'm interested in networking, virtualization, and devops.

I recently completed the Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate AZ-104, and I am now working towards the CCNA 300-201 1.1 Routing and Switching certification. 
I am endlessly fascinated by how systems talk to each other, and how they can be implemented, maintained and controlled by automated processes that make everyone's life more awesome.
