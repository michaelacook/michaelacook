### Hey there, I'm Mike ðŸ––
I am an A+ and 2x Microsoft certified IT professional and compulsive tinkerer. This is where I keep my projects, notes, and code.

I recently completed the Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate AZ-104, and I am now working towards the Cisco Certified Network Associate - Routing and Switching, and the Microsoft Certified: Windows Server Hybrid Administrator. 
I am endlessly fascinated by how systems talk to each other, and how they can be implemented, maintained and controlled by automated processes that make everyone's life more awesome.
