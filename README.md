### Hi there, I'm Michael ðŸ––
I'm a full-stack web developer willing to learn any technology needed to get a job done. My favourite tech to work with is Node, Express, Sequelize ORM and React. After coding as a hobby for years, I recently completed an online bootcamp and I am now looking for my first professional opportunity :eyes:
