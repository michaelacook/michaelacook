### Hi there, I'm Michael ðŸ––
I am an IT student and an aspiring system administrator and developer. I love technology, but there is a special place in my heart for GNU/Linux and free/libre software :penguin:.

I am currently studying for the CompTIA Linux+ and Microsoft Certified Azure Administrator certifications, working on some side projects, making a tonne of markdown notes, and trying to maintain my 4.1 GPA.
